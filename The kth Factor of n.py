#The kth Factor of n
#You are given two positive integers n and k. 
# A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.

#Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, 
# return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.

 
#Example 1:

#Input: n = 12, k = 3
#Output: 3
#Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd factor is 3.

class Solution:
    def kthFactor(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        aux = []
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if n % i == 0:
                aux.append(i)

        aux.sort()

        if len(aux) > k-1:
            return aux[k-1]
        return -1
